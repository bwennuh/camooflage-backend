## About Camooflage

Are you someone who is lactose intolerant and have just tried to ignore that it was a thing, but deep down know you should really give up dairy? Well this app is for you!

One of the main reasons it’s hard for people to give up dairy is because they don’t know what options there are out there for replacements. Especially nowadays, there are so many options to choose from, but there are also certain options better for certain culinary dairy needs.

Camooflage is a non-dairy replacement app. Think Pinterest, but for non-dairy milks, cheeses, ice cream, and more! It is designed to help users find non-dairy options to replace any dairy product that they need replacing for. If there's a dairy product you need a non-dairy replacement for, we can help you find it! This app is for those with allergies, lactose-intolerance, vegan lifestyles, plant-based diets, are looking to reduce their dairy consumption, or just want to know all about non-dairy options!

## Non-Dairy Products

The home page main feed displays all of the non-dairy products currently in the Camooflage database (which can be found ). Currently the app includes various non-dairy milks, cheeses, and ice cream, but is constantly being updated to include new products, including non-dairy yogurts, sour creams, butters, etc. The database has been curated by yours truly, so if there's an option you want to see included that's not on there - just let me know!

The database includes various product types, including refrigerated items, shelf stable items, and frozen items. There are also products of various base types, be it soy based, cashew based, oat based, etc.

Users can browse all the various options in the database, filter based on allergens, brands, and/or product categories, or they can search for a specific item.

Each item instance includes its allergen information, a product description, a picture of the product, a link on where to buy the product, and a personalized product recommendation (written by me!). Each item is also linked to a category and a brand.

As the database gets filled out, more information for each product may come in to play, so stay tuned to see what else is in store!
